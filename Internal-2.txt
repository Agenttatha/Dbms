     INSERT INTO emp (eid, ename, sal, did) VALUES  (8, 'Employee 9', 1800, 3);
 

 
CREATE TABLE dept (
    did INT,
    dname VARCHAR(50)
);
 
INSERT INTO dept (did, dname) VALUES (1, 'Department 1');
 INSERT INTO dept (did, dname) VALUES      (2, 'Department 2');
    INSERT INTO dept (did, dname) VALUES   (3, 'Department 3');

SELECT d.dname AS DepartmentName, MAX(e1.salary) AS ThirdHighestSalary
FROM department d
JOIN employee e1 ON d.did = e1.did
WHERE 3 = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.salary)
    FROM employee e2
    WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary AND e1.did = e2.did
)
GROUP BY d.dname; 

Question Number 3:

3. Consider tables Emp and Dept.
Emp ( eid, ename, sal, did)
Dept (did, dname)
Find the number of employees in each department whose salary is greater than average salary of their own
department. Output table should have two column one is dname and other is count of employees as said above.

Ans 3:
-- Creating the Dept table
CREATE TABLE Dept (
    did NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    dname VARCHAR2(50)
);

-- Inserting sample department data
INSERT INTO Dept (did, dname)
VALUES
    (1, 'HR'),
    (2, 'Engineering'),
    (3, 'Sales');

-- Creating the Emp table
CREATE TABLE Emp (
    eid NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    ename VARCHAR2(50),
    sal NUMBER(10, 2),
    did NUMBER,
   
);

-- Inserting sample employee data
INSERT INTO Emp (eid, ename, sal, did)
VALUES
    (1, 'Alice', 60000.00, 1);
INSERT INTO Emp (eid, ename, sal, did)
VALUES
    (2, 'Bob', 75000.00, 1);
INSERT INTO Emp (eid, ename, sal, did)
VALUES
    (3, 'Charlie', 80000.00, 2);
INSERT INTO Emp (eid, ename, sal, did)
VALUES
    (4, 'David', 90000.00, 2);
INSERT INTO Emp (eid, ename, sal, did)
VALUES
    (5, 'Eve', 50000.00, 3);
INSERT INTO Emp (eid, ename, sal, did)
VALUES
    (6, 'Frank', 55000.00, 3);
INSERT INTO Emp (eid, ename, sal, did)
VALUES
    (7, 'Grace', 60000.00, 3);
INSERT INTO Emp (eid, ename, sal, did)
VALUES
    (8, 'Helen', 70000.00, 3);


SELECT d.dname, COUNT(*) AS count_of_employees
FROM Dept d
JOIN Emp e ON d.did = e.did
WHERE e.sal > (
    SELECT AVG(sal)
    FROM Emp
    WHERE did = d.did
)
GROUP BY d.dname;


Question Number 4:

CREATE TABLE sample (
col1 varchar(10),
col2 varchar(10),
);

INSERT INTO sample  
VALUES
('X','Y');
INSERT INTO sample  
VALUES
('A','B');
INSERT INTO sample  
VALUES
('X','Y');
INSERT INTO sample  
VALUES
('K','L');

4A. Delete the Unique records (which are seen only once) from table in single shot

 DELETE e1FROM Emp e1
 JOIN (SELECT col1, col2, COUNT(*) AS count_occurrences FROM Emp
 GROUP BY col1, col2 HAVING COUNT(*) = 1) e2 ON e1.col1 = e2.col1
 AND e1.col2 = e2.col2; 

4B. Delete duplicate records ( which are seen more than once ) from table in single shot. 

DELETE FROM Emp
 WHERE eid IN (SELECT eid FROM
 (SELECT eid, ROW_NUMBER() OVER

 (PARTITION BY col1, col2 ORDER BY eid) AS rn FROM Emp)

 AS t WHERE rn > 1);
